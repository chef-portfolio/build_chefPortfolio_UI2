# Purpose
This is the marketing landing page and 'about-us' pages for the website **chef portfolio**. The pitch was from a food blogger who wanted to be able to show off their work and recipes. They had some amazing recipes and pictures to go along. They were seeking a website that is in essence, the "Instagram for chefs." They were hoping templates could be used to input information since they were not familiar with building webpages, nor did they have the time to learn. 

### Why?
This was a project built during one of Lambda School's Build Weeks. As the Web User Interface Developer, my role was to focus on the html, css, and javascript of the landing page. The front-end and back-end work was done by the other team members. We were required to collaborate on the overall product and message we wanted to push in our final product. 

# Features
These pages are responsive with numerous breakpoints to account for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (was build with a mobile-first design). The animate.less library was used to add animations. 

# Contributors
The other members of this project are: *Addison Stavlo* (Team Lead), *Tigran Sargsyan* (front-end), *Alexandria Supriana* (back-end), and *Benjamin Ajewole* (Web UI Developer). This project would not have been completed without their work and assistance.
